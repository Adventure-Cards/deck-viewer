  <summary>What is Adventure Cards?</summary>
  
  * Adventure Cards started as an NFT project inspired by Loot and Magic: The Gathering. Each original Adventure Cards deck includes 45 procedurally-generated card titles. Since launch, a community of builders has begun developing a full-fledged trading card game with mechanics similar to Hearthstone or MTG.

### Contributing to this repository
The game client is a Next.js app that makes heavy use of `tailwindcss`, `redux-toolkit`, and `socket.io-client`. To run the client app locally, you'll also need to clone and run the [game server](https://github.com/Adventure-Cards/game-server).

Please take a look at the open issues, or reach out on [discord](https://discord.gg/YdgRxhMq) if you can't find a good place to start.
